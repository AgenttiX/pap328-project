\section*{Abstract}
In this project we assembled a gas-based proportional counter for X-ray and $\gamma$-ray detection.
The detector was based on a 0,5 l drink can, which had an anode wire along its center.
The detector was filled with the P10 gas mixture, and high voltage ($>$ 2000 V) was applied between the anode and the can.
In these conditions when high-energy radation ionizes the gas, the resulting electrons drift towards the anode wire.
Close to the wire the field strength is high enough for avalanche formation, and the electrons are multiplied, resulting in an electrical pulse that can be detected with electronics.

The system was tested with Fe-55 and Am-241 sources, and a multichannel analyzer was used to collect the emission spectra, which were then analyzed with self-developed software.
This setup demonstrated sufficient resolution to distinguish the ASDF peaks.

The detector was also tested with a self-built pre-amplifier.
However, these results were inconclusive due to unexpected degradation of the detector.
These measurements are discussed in the appendix \ref{pre_amp}.

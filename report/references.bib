	abstract = {{NASA}’s X-ray spectrometer ({XRS}) microcalorimeter instrument has been operating at the electron beam ion trap ({EBIT}) facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory since July of 2000. The spectrometer is currently undergoing its third major upgrade to become an easy to use and extremely high-performance instrument for a broad range of {EBIT} experiments. The spectrometer itself is broadband, capable of simultaneously operating from 0.1 to 12 {keV} and has been operated at up to 100 {keV} by manipulating its operating conditions. The spectral resolution closely follows the spaceflight version of the {XRS}, beginning at 10 {eV} {FWHM} at 6 {keV} in 2000, upgraded to 5.5 {eV} in 2003, and will hopefully be {\textasciitilde}3.8 {eV} in the fall of 2007. Here we review the operating principles of this unique instrument, the extraordinary science that has been performed at {EBIT} over the last six years, and prospects for future upgrades. Specifically, we discuss upgrades to cover the high-energy band (to at least 100 {keV}) with a high quantum efficiency detector and prospects for using a new superconducting detector to reach 0.8 {eV} resolution at 1 {keV} and 2 {eV} at 6 {keV} with high counting rates. {PACS} Nos.: 52.25.Os, 52.70.La, 95.85.Nv, 32.30.Rj, 07.85.Fv, 78.70.En},

	abstract = {"This is the resource that engineers turn to in the study of radiation detection. The fourth edition takes into account the technical developments that continue to enhance the instruments and techniques available for the detection and spectroscopy of ionizing radiation. New coverage is presented on {ROC} curves, micropattern gas detectors, new sensors for scintillation light, and the excess noise factor. Revised discussions are also included on {TLDs} and cryogenic spectrometers, radiation backgrounds, and the {VME} standard. Engineers will gain a strong understanding of the field with this updated book."--},
